Creating a new Domain Specific Definition (DSD) package

Let's say you want to create a new set of dark-matter based Domain Specific Definitions (DSDs) that
allow you to capture concepts associated with some problem domain. For example, let's say you want
to extend the concepts around Google Protocol Buffers (GPB) to allow for capture of the semantics
around how a particular protocol is to be used and, from this specification, generate the GPB
protocol specification and a nice set of documentation to which you developers can refer when
building applications that use the protocol.

Looking the Language Guide section of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto"> Developer Guide </a>
we see the basic concepts of message types being comprised of a collection of fields with specific types and 
indications of whether they are required, optional or repeated. This is a good starting point, so let's start
with that much.
