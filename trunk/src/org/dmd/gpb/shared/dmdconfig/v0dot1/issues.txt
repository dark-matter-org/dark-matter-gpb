How to handled the standard concept of a definition being defined in a module i.e. setting a definedInXModule attribute on all definitions
For now, just using a string for definedInGpbModule


Same issue with usesDefsFrom - this is a module specific attribute, but it would be better if we had a generic way of handling this
